	abstract = {We introduce Single Node Genetic Programming ({SNGP}), a new graph-based model for genetic programming in which every individual in the population consists of a single program node. Function operands are other individuals, meaning that the graph structure is imposed externally on the population as a whole, rather than existing within its members. Evolution is via a hill-climbing mechanism using a single reversible operator. Experimental results indicate substantial improvements over conventional {GP} in terms of solution rates, efficiency and program sizes.},

	abstract = {Single Node Genetic Programming ({SNGP}) offers a new approach to {GP} in which every member of the population consists of just a single program node. Operands are formed from other members of the population, and evolution is driven by a hill-climbing approach using a single reversible operator. When the functions being used in the problem are free from side effects, it is possible to make use of a form of dynamic programming, which provides huge efficiency gains. In this research we turn our attention to the use of {SNGP} when the solution of problems relies on the presence of side effects. We demonstrate that {SNGP} can still be superior to conventional {GP}, and examine the role of evolutionary strategies in achieving this.},

	abstract = {Genetic Programming is applied to the task of evolving general iterative sorting algorithms. A connection between size and generality was discovered. Adding inverse size to the fitness measure along with correctness not only decreases the size of the resulting evolved algorithms, but also dramatically increases their generality and thus the effectiveness of the evolution process. In addition, a variety of differing problem formulations are investigated and the relative probability of success for each is reported. An example of an evolved sort from each problem formulation is presented, and an initial attempt is made to understand the variations in difficulty resulting from these differing problem formulations.},

	title = {Evolving a Sort: Lessons in Genetic Programming},
	shorttitle = {Evolving a Sort},
	abstract = {In applying the Genetic Programming paradigm to the task of evolving iterative sorting algorithms, a variety of interesting lessons were learned. With proper selection of the primitives, sorting algorithms were evolved that are both general and non-trivial. The sorting problem was then used as a testbed to evaluate the value of several alternative parameters, with some small gains shown. The value of applying Steady State Genetic Algorithm techniques to Genetic Programming, called Steady State Genetic Programming is demonstrated. One unusual genetic operator was created, non-fitness single crossover, which shows promise in at least this environment.  I. {INTRODUCTION} Trying to evolve even as relatively simple an algorithm as a sorting routine can teach a number of useful lessons concerning the power as well as the pitfalls of using genetic techniques to directly evolve computer programs.

	isbn = {978-1-4092-0073-4},
	abstract = {Genetic programming ({GP}) is a systematic, domain-independent method for getting computers to solve problems automatically starting from a high-level statement of what needs to be done. Using ideas from natural evolution, {GP} starts from an ooze of random computer programs, and progressively refines them through processes of mutation and sexual recombination, until high-fitness solutions emerge. All this without the user having to know or specify the form or structure of solutions in advance. {GP} has generated a plethora of human-competitive results and applications, including novel scientific discoveries and patentable inventions. This unique overview of this exciting technique is written by three of the most active scientists in {GP}. See www.gp-field-guide.org.uk for more information on the book.},
